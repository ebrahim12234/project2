        <h1><em>*Basketball</em></h1>
       <h4> <p>Basketball is a popular sport played by two teams, each with five players, on a rectangular court. The goal of the game is to score points by shooting the ball through the opponent’s hoop, which is placed 10 feet above the ground. Players use their hands to dribble and pass the ball, and they aim to outscore the other team within a set time limit.

        The game is divided into four quarters, and each team tries to outplay the other with a combination of offense and defense. Offense involves scoring by making shots from different areas on the court, while defense is about stopping the opposing team from scoring by blocking shots, stealing the ball, or forcing turnovers.
        
        Basketball was invented by Dr. James Naismith in 1891, and since then, it has become one of the most popular sports worldwide. The National Basketball Association (NBA) in the United States is the most famous league, featuring some of the greatest players in history, such as Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant.
        
        Basketball is not only a competitive sport but also a great way to improve fitness, teamwork, and communication skills. It is played in schools, parks, and professional arenas, attracting millions of fans across the globe.
        
        In conclusion, basketball is an exciting and fast-paced sport that brings people together to enjoy the thrill of competition and teamwork. It continues to grow in popularity, inspiring future generations to play and watch the game.</p></h4>
