        <h1>*Volleyball </h1>
        <h4><p>Volleyball is an exciting team sport played by two teams, each with six players, on a rectangular court divided by a net. The goal of the game is to send the ball over the net and into the opponent's court while making sure they can't return it. Players use their hands to hit the ball, but they can also use their arms, legs, and even their heads to pass, set, or spike the ball.

            A volleyball match is usually played in sets, and the first team to reach a certain number of points wins the set. A team needs to win a specific number of sets (usually 3 out of 5) to win the match. Each team can hit the ball up to three times before it must go over the net, and they try to outplay their opponents by using tactics, such as powerful spikes and well-timed blocks.
            
            Volleyball can be played indoors or outdoors, and it is popular at both professional and recreational levels. The sport was invented by William G. Morgan in 1895, and it quickly grew in popularity around the world. Today, volleyball is played in schools, at professional sports events, and even on beaches in the form of beach volleyball.
            
            The sport requires teamwork, communication, and athletic skill. Famous volleyball players include Kerri Walsh Jennings, Misty May-Treanor, and Sergey Tetyukhin, who have all achieved great success in the sport. Volleyball is also a prominent event in the Summer Olympics, where teams from around the world compete for the gold medal.
            
            In conclusion, volleyball is a fun and fast-paced sport that promotes teamwork, coordination, and fitness. It is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide and continues to grow in popularity.</p></h4>
