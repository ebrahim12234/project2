        <h1> <em>*Tennis</em></h1>
        <h4><p>Tennis is a popular sport played on a rectangular court, either indoors or outdoors, with a net in the middle. The game can be played individually (singles) or with two players on each team (doubles). The goal is to hit the ball over the net and into the opponent's side of the court, while making sure the ball lands within the boundaries.

            A tennis match is played in sets, and the player who wins the most sets wins the match. Points are won by hitting the ball in a way that the opponent cannot return it. Players use a racket to hit a small rubber ball, and the ball must pass over the net without touching it. The game requires skill, strategy, and physical endurance, as players need to be quick and precise in their movements.
            
            Tennis has a long history, dating back to the 12th century in France. The modern version of the sport was developed in England in the late 19th century. Today, tennis is played all around the world, with major tournaments such as Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, the French Open, and the Australian Open attracting global audiences.
            
            Some of the greatest tennis players in history include Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, and Novak Djokovic. These players are known for their exceptional talent, sportsmanship, and dedication to the sport.
            
            In conclusion, tennis is a fast-paced and exciting sport that requires skill, focus, and determination. It is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide, both as a competitive sport and a recreational activity.</p></h4>
